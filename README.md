## Project Name:
A lightweight prosthetic hand with 19-DOF dexterity and human-level functions

## Description:
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the lightweight prosthetic hand project. The lightweight prosthetic hand is designed to help individuals with amputated hands restore the function of their hand. It includes control software and hardware components for the prosthetic hand.
- "GeneralUI" is a supervisory interface program developed in MATLAB. It is designed for debugging prosthetic hands, as well as for the collection and analysis of experimental data. The program provides a user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with the prosthetic hand and conducting experiments related to prosthetic hand grasping studies.
- The "Voice Controller" repository contains prosthetic hand control firmware, specifically designed to run on systems based on the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller. The firmware facilitates voice control and manipulation of prosthetic hands, suitable for various applications including research on object grasping and hand manipulation.
- "workspace_index_prosthesis_and_human"  is a MATLAB-based program designed to calculate the workspace of both the human index finger and a prosthetic index finger.
- "workspace_thumb_prosthesis_and_human" is a MATLAB-based program designed to calculate the workspace of both the human thumb and a prosthetic thumb.

## Platform:
The code is intended to run on the following platform(s):
- Windows

## IDE:
We recommend using the following integrated development environments (IDEs) to work with this code:
- MATLAB
- Keil5
- STM32CubeIDE
